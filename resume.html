	<h2 class= "prevwork">March 2017 - December2018, Ripleys Believe it or Not.</h2>
	<p class = "prevwork">I worked as the front desk attendant at Ripley's, selling tickets and answering general inquiries.
	I also worked in the gift shop, greeting guests as they exited the museum and upselling products before they left.
	Every closing shift was required to do a deep clean of the building and "reset" the gift shop for the next day's business.
	I breifly worked as a photographer, taking guest's photos to be sold at a later time.

	<p class ="prevwork"> At Books-A-Million, my main duty was barista, taking customer drink orders and fulfilling them in a timely manner.
	As lead barista, it was also my job to keep aan accurate inventory list of the cafe's product for ordering purposes. I was one of three employees trained in both
	the cafe and the book sales departments, which meant it was my job to make sure both ran smoothly and had adequate staffing.
