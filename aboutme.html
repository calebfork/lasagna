  <div class="bio">
    <p>I was born in North-Central Missouri near Columbia, but have
    lived in Branson, Missouri since I was around five years old.
    Both my parents had fine art degrees and instilled a strong
    love for the arts within me as a young child. For as long
    as I can remember, I've been drawing, painting, and sculpting.
    My favorite media to use is pen and ink, but I find myself wanting
    more and more to start using digital media to create art.</p>
